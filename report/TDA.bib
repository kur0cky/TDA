pages="5--21",
abstract="The most widely used measures of time series proximity are the Euclidean distance and dynamic time warping. The latter can be derived from the distance introduced by Maurice Fr{\'e}chet in 1906 to account for the proximity between curves. The major limitation of these proximity measures is that they are based on the closeness of the values regardless of the similarity w.r.t. the growth behavior of the time series. To alleviate this drawback we propose a new dissimilarity index, based on an automatic adaptive tuning function, to include both proximity measures w.r.t. values and w.r.t. behavior. A comparative numerical analysis between the proposed index and the classical distance measures is performed on the basis of two datasets: a synthetic dataset and a dataset from a public health study.",

  abstract={This paper shows that the space of persistence diagrams has properties that allow for the definition of probability measures which support expectations, variances, percentiles and conditional probabilities. This provides a theoretical basis for a statistical treatment of persistence diagrams, for example computing sample averages and sample variances of persistence diagrams. We first prove that the space of persistence diagrams with the Wasserstein metric is complete and separable. We then prove a simple criterion for compactness in this space. These facts allow us to show the existence of the standard statistical objects needed to extend the theory of topological persistence to a much larger set of applications.}

pages="17",
abstract="Persistent homology (PH) is a method used in topological data analysis (TDA) to study qualitative features of data that persist across multiple scales. It is robust to perturbations of input data, independent of dimensions and coordinates, and provides a compact representation of the qualitative features of the input. The computation of PH is an open area with numerous important and fascinating challenges. The field of PH computation is evolving rapidly, and new algorithms and software implementations are being updated and released at a rapid pace. The purposes of our article are to (1) introduce theory and computational methods for PH to a broad range of computational scientists and (2) provide benchmarks of state-of-the-art implementations for the computation of PH. We give a friendly introduction to PH, navigate the pipeline for the computation of PH with an eye towards applications, and use a range of synthetic and real-world data sets to evaluate currently available open-source implementations for the computation of PH. Based on our benchmarking, we indicate which algorithms and implementations are best suited to different types of data sets. In an accompanying tutorial, we provide guidelines for the computation of PH. We make publicly available all scripts that we wrote for the tutorial, and we make available the processed version of the data sets used in the benchmarking.",
